<h1>TECH120 Final Project</h1>

<h2>Group 3's Final Project for TECH120 at Purdue University</h2>

<h3>Members: Jenny, Arrow, Luke, and Harjot</h3>

<p>
    Our objective is to create a solution for anybody who wishes to balance their consumption of short-form media with studying.
    How this is achieved is through a display of a clock, where they are allowed n amount of time on selected or default short-form media platforms.
    <b>This project is specifically for web applications, and not mobile devices.</b>
</p>

An example may be as follows:
<ul>
    <li> The default constrictions of the timer are that of the Pomodoro Study Technique </li> 
    <li> The user is allowed 5 minutes (break) on websites such as YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram Reels, etcetera </li>
    <li> After 5 minutes of having these websites open, they are not allowed for 25 minutes </li>
    <li> Additionally, a clock will appear when they are scrolling, displaying the total amount of time they've spent scrolling </li>
</ul>
